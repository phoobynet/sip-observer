# Securities Information Processor (SIP) Observer

Using one or more symbols, SIP Observer will capture trades and bars.

In addition, snapshots and assets are downloaded on each restart.

This does not provide query services, just capture.  You will need to build another application on top of QuestDB to get anything useful out of it.

## Requirements

- [Alpaca Market Data](https://alpaca.markets/data) SIP access (currently $99)
- [QuestDB](https://questdb.io/docs/) - A time series database that is very fast.

## Installation

Set the following environment variables

- `APCA_API_KEY_ID` - Your Alpaca Key
- `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` - Your Alpaca Secret

Install the packages

```bash
go install github.com/phoobynet/sip-observer@latest
```

Create `.toml` file, and decide what symbols you would like to include.  

- `title` - Whatever you want it to be.
- `symbols` - e.g. `"AAPL"`, etc. Note that `*` means everything (really hope your hardware is up to it).
- `db_host` - The host address of QuestDB
- `db_ilp_port` - ILP ingestion port; the default is `9009`
- `db_pg_port` - Postgres(ish) port; the default is `8812`

**Example `config.toml`**

```toml
title = "Everything"

symbols = [
    "*",
]

db_host = "localhost"
db_lip_port = "9009"
db_pg_port = "8812"
```

Assuming you have a QuestDB server up and running, start `sip-observer`

```bash
sip-observer --config config.toml
```
